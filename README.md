Nothing really here yetâ€¦ But eventually it'll be _AWESOME_!

Possible Working Title: *FORSAKEN REALM*

## To-Do:
* Simple map creation _DONE_
* Terrain effects (right now all terrain are the same outside of color)
    * <attribute> <operator> <effect> (eg moveCost * 2)
    * require <attribute> <comparison> <value> (eg size < 7)
* Game Creation _DONE_
* Basic gameplay (skirmish mode: purchase characters, place them, fight until no one's left)

## Down the road ideas:
* Other game modes (CTF, race, ability to add NPCs, co-op)
* Character sets (to make it easier to choose what characters should be included in games, especially once there's more user-created content)
* Campaign (First just a number of game types lined up in a row, later add some abilities to include storyline)
* Tournament
* Linking maps to character sets
* Player stats/rankings
* Custom attributes (abilities that only apply to certain character sets or game types)
* Abilities (Effects on surrounding characters, etc)
* Cell-specific effects (Permanent modifiers that are attached to specific locations on a map)
* Character icons
* Limit initial placement/# of players as a map setting
* Push server (either use my own Node.JS server with Socket.IO or use something like PubNub or Photon Server/Cloud)
* In-game messaging
* HTML5 audio (on button presses, etc)
